Summary
I've created a complete, production-ready Restaurant Order Management API with proper file structure and comprehensive functionality:
🏗️ Architecture

MVC Pattern: Proper separation of concerns
Modular Structure: Each component has its own file
Middleware Pipeline: Authentication, validation, error handling
Database Layer: Centralized DB configuration and queries

🔧 Key Features

Full CRUD operations for all entities
Order Management: Create orders, add items, track status, billing
Menu Management: Categories, items, availability, search
Table Management: Availability tracking, capacity management
Customer Management: Profile and order history
Staff Management: Role-based access (ready for auth)

🛡️ Security & Validation

Input Validation with express-validator
SQL Injection Protection with parameterized queries
Error Handling with detailed logging
Rate Limiting and security headers
Standardized Responses across all endpoints

📊 Business Logic

Automatic Billing: Calculates subtotal, tax, total
Order Status Tracking: From pending to completed
Table Availability: Automatic table management
Menu Search: Filter by category, price, dietary restrictions
Reporting: Daily summaries and statistics

🚀 API Endpoints
Core Resources:

/api/categories - Menu categories management
/api/menu - Full menu with search and filtering
/api/tables - Table availability and management
/api/orders - Complete order lifecycle
/api/customers - Customer management
/api/staff - Staff and role management

Key Order Flow:

POST /api/orders - Create order
POST /api/orders/:id/items - Add menu items
PUT /api/orders/:id/status - Update status (confirmed → preparing → ready → served → completed)
PUT /api/orders/:id/discount - Apply discounts
Order totals calculated automatically with tax
